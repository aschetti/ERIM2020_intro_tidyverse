# A taste of data science using R and the `tidyverse`

## Introduction

[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) is a popular programming language used in academic and non-academic settings to develop statistical software and data analysis pipelines. In this workshop you will learn some functionalities of the [**`tidyverse`**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of _R_ packages for data manipulation and plotting that is easily readable not only for machines, but also for humans. You will load a preselected dataset, manipulate it in various ways (e.g., variable renaming, filtering, and recoding), visualize it to better understand its hidden relationships, and perform simple statistical analyses. These operations will be run in an environment that ensures computational reproducibility: if you have the initial dataset, you will be able to reproduce the final results with a mouse click.
